Flag: BYPASS_CTF{D34D_M4N5_CH35T}

### 2. Jigsaw Puzzle

Arrange the parts to form the image, write down the string that you get with the little letters: `Gurcnffjbeqvf:oLCNFF_PGS{RVTUG_CBRPRF_BS_R\TUG}`.

ROT13 that, we get our flag. `Thepasswordis:bYPASS_CTF{EIGHT_POECES_OF_E\GHT}` (idk why were flags crooked like this, maybe I read it wrong, fix the grammar and its correct)

Flag: BYPASS_CTF{EIGHT_PIECES_OF_EIGHT}

### 3. the music one 

It was playing a C major scale ie: CDEFGABC, the notes were BADFACE. Being a musician helped in a CTF lol.

Flag: BYPASS_CTF{BADFACE}
