LCS which stands for longest common sequence, returns the length string depending on how similar two strings are in order from left to right. What we needed here was a script that could run through all alphanumeric characters and also symbols.

```python

import socket
import string

HOST = "iitmandi.co.in"
PORT = 8098

def get_lcs_length(guess):
    with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:
        s.connect((HOST, PORT))
        s.recv(1024)  # Read welcome message
        s.sendall(guess.encode() + b"\n")
        response = s.recv(1024).decode()
        return int(response.split(": ")[1])  # Extract LCS length

flag = "saic{"  # Start with the confirmed prefix

while True:
    found = False
    for char in string.printable:  # Test all printable characters
        test_flag = flag + char
        lcs_length = get_lcs_length(test_flag)
        
        if lcs_length == len(test_flag):  # If LCS matches guess length, it's correct
            flag = test_flag
            print(f"Progress: {flag}")
            found = True
            break  # Move to the next character
    
    if not found:
        print(f"Final flag: {flag}")
        break

```

This will take a while and eventually give us the flag. 

Flag: saic{3asy_dp_lc5_ch4ll3ng3}
