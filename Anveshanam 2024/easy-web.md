## Easy Web

> Just another CTF challenge

On launching instance we get a website with it saying something but highlighting the word `hard-web`. On looking at the hint it says `Look at the cookies`.

On looking at the cookies we find what looks like a base64 text which on decoding gave us `easy-web`

We change the value there to the base64 conversion of `hard-web` and refresh and we get our flag :D
