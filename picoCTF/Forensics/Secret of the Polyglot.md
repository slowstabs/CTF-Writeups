## Secret of the Polyglot

> The Network Operations Center (NOC) of your local institution picked up a suspicious file, they're getting conflicting information on what type of file it is. They've brought you in as an external expert to examine the file. Can you extract all the information from this strange file?
Download the suspicious file here.

What is given to us is a pdf called `flag2of2-final.pdf` which on opening gives us what looks like the second half of a flag.
