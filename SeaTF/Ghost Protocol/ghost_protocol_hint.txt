The ghosts communicate silently,
In space between moments they hide.
Count not the words, but the silence,
For in the emptiness, truth resides.

When windows open to the network,
Even and odd tell a story untold.
ICMP speaks more than it seems,
In its identity, secrets unfold.

DNS records hold the cipher,
But without the key, darkness remains.
Assemble the pieces with precision,
To reveal what the ghost contains.

When packets travel the wire unseen, Look not at what they say, but spaces between. Windows open and close with purpose untold, Even and odd, a pattern to behold. The echo's identity carries more than it seems, In microseconds, a hidden flag gleams.
